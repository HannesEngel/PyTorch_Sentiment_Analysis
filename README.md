# PyTorch_Sentiment_Analysis

## Background
Using Amazon Sagemaker to deploy a PyTorch sentiment analysis model (RNN) as part of my Machine Learning Udacity Nanodegree.

## Includes
- SageMaker Project.ipynb: This is a Jupyter Notebook in which the majority of the task was completed. The model was constructed and deployed in this notebook.
- index.html: Web page on which a user is able to enter a movie review. The model's classification of the review is also displayed on this web page once it's submitted.
- predict.py: This file serves as the entry point for the PyTorch model and contains the code that's used to test the model performance on a test set.
- report.html: This is just an html version of the Jupyter Notebook 'SageMaker Project.ipynb'
- train.py: This is the custom file that contains the code for training the model on the training data.
